\#\+Part2\+Part This is a peer-\/to-\/peer application meant to share files with anybody who\textquotesingle{}s connected to the server. Any client running this application will have support for uploading and downloading shared files on the network. It has support for both I\+Pv4, I\+Pv6, but only one of it may be used at a time. \subsection*{Dependencies}

You need the c++14 standard in order to compile and build the server and the client and Internet connectivity. \subsection*{Installation}

Download the project on your machine. After unzip-\/ing the downloaded file, navigate from the terminal to the unarchived folder and simply run the {\ttfamily make} command. \subsection*{Running the application}

By default, the {\ttfamily make} command creates 2 files\+: {\ttfamily server.\+out} and {\ttfamily client.\+out}. To start the server, simply run the {\ttfamily server.\+out} file (it takes no additional arguments). To start the client. run {\ttfamily client.\+out $<$server\+\_\+ip$>$ $<$listening\+\_\+port$>$}, where the {\ttfamily $<$listening\+\_\+port$>$} default value is 1234. An example of installing and running the application is\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily make} -\/ builds the binary files
\item {\ttfamily ./server.out} -\/ start the server on port {\ttfamily 1234}
\item {\ttfamily ./client.out 127.\+0.\+0.\+1 1234} -\/ connect to localhost on port 1234
\end{DoxyItemize}

After starting the client, the user has access to the following commands\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily add file} -\/ the application reads the relative path to a file which the user wishes to put at disposal for download
\item {\ttfamily show files} -\/ shows the available files for download
\item {\ttfamily download file} -\/ downloads a specific file; additional instructions are given inside the application
\item {\ttfamily exit} -\/ exits the application 
\end{DoxyItemize}
